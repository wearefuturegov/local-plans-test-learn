    Considerations to add depending on results:
  </p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>
          <strong>Urban dense areas</strong> If metrics indicate rising air pollution, integrate detailed air quality monitoring and environmental health studies.              
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Rural and dispersed areas</strong> If local economies rely on agricultural and/or tourism activities, include targeted economic viability and diversification studies.              
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Mixed-user or urban fringe areas</strong> Map overlapping zones and potential conflicts to ensure cohesive policies between residential, commercial, and industrial uses.              
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Areas with notable heritage/conversation designations</strong> Coordinate with economic assessments to identify potential grants or incentives for conservation projects.              
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Rapidly growing/expanding areas</strong> Cross-reference with urban dense or mixed-use studies if growth is concentrated in particular districts.              
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Coastal areas</strong> Link coastal studies with sustainability assessments from urban or rural branches as needed, ensuring environmental recommendations dovetail with local infrastructure modifications.              
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Proximty to an airport</strong> Integrate with urban dense or growth studies if the area experiences overlapping urban pressures, aligning transport and housing deliverables with airport-related impacts.              
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Heavy tourism based areas</strong>  Combine with cultural, environmental, and land-use studies to ensure tourism benefits are balanced against local resident needs and conservation priorities.
    </li>
  </ul>
